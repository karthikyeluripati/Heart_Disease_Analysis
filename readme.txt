Project Title: Heart Disease Analysis

Analyse the following dataset of heart disease which contains 918 observations with 12 attributes(heart.csv).
USE-CASE: Find out who's having more risk like by gender, age, any other factors.

The project contains one CSV (Comma Saperated Values) file which consists general information like age, gender
and also the factors which affect the chance of heart disease like cholesterol, blood pressure and etc. Pandas profiling 
was performed to obtain a detailed review of the dataset.Data analysis on these parameters is done in jupyter notebook 
and google colaboratory. Packages like MatPoltLib and Seaborn were used to obtain a pictorial representation of the data.

Based on the combination of several parameters the chance of having heart disease is found on the basis of age and 
gender(as mentioned in the use-case) along with it, this analysis brought up conclusions for several use-cases. Involved
other features like Cholosterol, Blood pressure, Blood Sugar level and monitored them according to the age and gender 
to understand there effect on heart disease. Final data has been downloaded after converting numerical to categorical and 
vice versa. Analysis, conclusions and code is present in both .ipynb and .html formats.
